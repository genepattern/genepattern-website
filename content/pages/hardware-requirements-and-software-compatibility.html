<h2>Hardware Requirements and Software Compatibility</h2>

<p>The hardware requirements and current technology versions reflect GenePattern version 3.9.8.&nbsp; The operating systems and browsers listed reflect those systems and browsers on which GenePattern 3.9.8&nbsp;has been tested.</p>

<p><strong><a name="browser_recs"></a>Browser recommendations</strong>: Note that, for most users, only a browser is needed to connect with and use <a href="http://genepattern.broadinstitute.org">GenePattern</a></p>

<p>GenePattern has been tested on the following browsers, as of June&nbsp;2016, with GenePattern 3.9.8:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Microsoft Edge</li>
	<li>Internet Explorer 11 (As of January 2014 GenePattern no longer supports IE10 or earlier versions)</li>
	<li>Firefox 39</li>
	<li>Chrome 50</li>
	<li>Safari 9&nbsp;(5.1+ required for Module Integrator and Pipeline Designer)</li>
</ul>

<p>Macintosh:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Use the most recent versions of Firefox or Safari
	<ul>
		<li>NOTE: Chrome version 39 was released in November of 2014. This is a 64-bit browser and thus supports Java 7 &amp; 8. If you use Chrome 39 on your Mac you should be able to upload large files (&gt;2 GB) to the Uploads tab (check your Java version&nbsp;<a href="http://javatester.org/version.html">here</a>)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>For those users who need to install*&nbsp;GenePattern:</h4>

<p>*Again, please note that there is no need to install GenePattern in order to <u><a href="http://genepattern.broadinstitute.org">use</a></u> it.</p>

<p><strong>Hardware requirements</strong>: GenePattern&#39;s hardware requirements are found on almost all currently available machines:</p>

<ul>
	<li>512 MB RAM (individual modules, such as NMFConsensus or the RNA-seq modules, may require additional RAM depending on the data being processed)</li>
	<li>500 MHz Pentium 3 or equivalent</li>
	<li>Server space: 252 MB</li>
	<li>Module space: As of May 2013, installing all GenePattern modules requires approximately 2 GB of hard drive space, and analysis space requires approximately 10 GB</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Current technology versions</strong>: Following are the technology versions used in GenePattern 3.9.8.</p>

<ul>
	<li>GenePattern 3.9.3+ requires Java 7. Older versions require Java 6, Java 8 is supported.&nbsp;Please note that we support Oracle Java, and do not support Open Java, and that you will need to install the JDK, not just the JRE.</li>
	<li>R 2.5.0 (Included in Windows* installs. Other versions of R can be installed to run with GenePattern modules as needed. See the <a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/gp_guides/administrators-guide/sections/r-versions">Using Different Versions of R in-depth article</a> for more information.)</li>
	<li>Perl 5.8.8 (Windows* installs only - <a href="/doc/relnotes/3.9.3#admin" target="_blank">Please note that the Windows installer is now deprecated.</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>*Please see our <a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/blog" target="_blank">Blog</a> for information on recent issues with Java updates and GenePattern.</p>

<p><strong>Tested operating systems:</strong> GenePattern installers are available for&nbsp;Mac OS X, and Linux. GenePattern should work with any operating system that has a Java 7 virtual machine installed, and likely on those with Java 8. (We have done minimal testing with Java 8 servers and found few issues.) We have tested it on the following OS platforms for the release of GenePattern 3.9.8:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Mac: OS X 10.9, 10.10, 10.11</li>
	<li>Linux: Ubuntu 14.04, CentOS 5, Red Hat 6&nbsp;(Note: these are only the platforms we test; GenePattern works on other Linux platforms as well</li>
</ul>

<p>*Note that the <a href="/doc/relnotes/3.9.3#admin" target="_blank">Windows installer is deprecated</a> as of the 3.9.3 release.</p>
