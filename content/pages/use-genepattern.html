<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The GenePattern team and collaborating organizations maintain several servers that can be used without installing any software. All that is needed is to register (Note that each server must be registered for separately).&nbsp;More information about the servers is provided below.</p>

<p>Please do not use a public GenePattern server to analyze <a href="#phi">protected health information.</a></p>
