<ul>
	<li>an intuitive graphical user interface for users at all levels of computational sophistication</li>
	<li>comprehensive repository of clustering, prediction, preprocessing, and visualization modules for analysis of microarray data</li>
	<li>a pipeline environment that allows users to chain tasks together to create and share methodologies</li>
	<li>a module integration environment that allows rapid, code-free integration of new tools</li>
	<li>a programming environment that allows users to access GenePattern modules from the Java, MATLAB, and R programming languages</li>
</ul>
