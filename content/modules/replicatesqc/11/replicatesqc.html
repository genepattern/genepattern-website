<h2>
	Introduction</h2>
<p>
	ReplicatesQC is a GenePattern module that implements quality control steps during the analysis of shRNA pooled screen data. The user inputs at least one and up to three GCT files containing shRNA data, with each file containing data from a separate batch. The correlation scores for cell line replicates are calculated and a replicate sample will fail QC if the correlation score is less than the threshold, which is the 75th percentile of the non-replicate correlation scores. The distribution scores for cell line replicates are calculated and a replicate sample will fail QC if the distribution score is less than the threshold, which is the mean of the distribution scores minus the standard deviation of the distribution scores. If there are not at least 3 replicate samples passing QC for each cell line, all replicates for that cell line will be added to the failed replicate sample list. </p>

		<ul>
<li>
				A pdf of the boxplot of non-replicate correlations, displaying the distribution of non-replicate correlation values. Cell line replicates pass the correlation quality control step if their correlation values exceed the 75th percentile of the non-replicate correlation values. </li>

		File containing replicate correlation values                     Replicate_Correlations_<em>[extension]</em>.txt
		<ul>
<li>
				A text file containing the pairwise replicate correlations for all cell lines. The 75th percentile of the non-replicate correlation values is included at the beginning of the file, which is the threshold a replicate needs to exceed in order to pass quality control.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
		File listing replicate samples that fail the replicate correlation requirements                        Reproducibility_Failing_Samples_<em>[extension]</em>.txt

		Histogram of distribution scores                Histogram_75thprctile_<em>[extension]</em>.pdf
		<ul>
<li>
				A pdf of the histogram of distribution scores. The red line represents the first threshold (the mean of distribution scores minus the standard deviation of distribution scores) and the magenta line represents the second threshold (the mean of distribution scores minus two times the standard deviation of distribution scores). </li>
