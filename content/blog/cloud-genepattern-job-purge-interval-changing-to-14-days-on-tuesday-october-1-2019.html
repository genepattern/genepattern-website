<p>Since officially switching to cloud.genepattern.org as our official production GenePattern server in January of this year, we have seen a steady increase in the number and size of jobs being run on the server, which is fantastic! We love that we have been able to provide a platform for so much great science, and we want to continue to do so. So, to limit our storage costs, and make sure that we can sustain this free service, we will be shortening our job purge interval from 30 days to 14 days as of Tuesday, October 1, 2019.</p>
<p>What this means is that any jobs older than 14 days as of Oct 1 will be purged from the server, and any jobs run on Oct 1 and beyond will be retained on the server for 14 days. <em>This does not impact data you have uploaded to the Files tab.</em></p>
<p>If you have jobs you wish to retain for longer than 14 days, you have a few options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reload the job - this creates a new job with the same parameters and outputs which now has another 14-day lease on life.
	<ul>
<li>Click the job title (module name or job id) and select <em>Reload Job</em></li>
<li>To Rerun with the same parameters as before, simply click <em>Run</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Download the job - this saves a zip with the outputs and execution log to your local device
	<ul>
<li>Click the job title (module name or job id) and select <em>Download Job</em></li>
</ul>
