<p><strong>UPDATE 4:00PM EDT, Aug 25, 2017</strong></p>
<p>Both the public server and the internal server are back online, and users can successfully run jobs and login to the GenePattern Notebook Repository.</p>
<p>We are continuing to monitor the situation and there may be a few more, brief, periods of downtime as we continue to improve the performance of the servers. </p>
<p>We recommend holding off on any big data pipelines or batch jobs until Monday.</p>
<p>If you have a failed job, which has a tag and/or comments which indicate a system error (see below), this means that the job was unrecoverable when the server was restarted. </p>
<p>We apologize again for any inconvenience.</p>

<hr/>
<p>The Broad Hosted GenePattern Servers, which are located at the following URLs:</p>
<p><a href="https://genepattern.broadinstitute.org/" target="_blank">genepattern.broadinstitute.org</a> (public)</p>
<p><a href="https://gpbroad.broadinstitute.org/" target="_blank">gpbroad.broadinstitute.org</a> (internal to Broad)</p>
<p>are both currently experiencing performance issues which have made them unavailable.</p>
<p>This has also blocked the ability for users to login to the GenePattern Notebook Repository located at <a href="https://notebook.genepattern.org" target="_blank">https://notebook.genepattern.org</a>. You may still run a <a href="http://genepattern-notebook.org/install/" target="_blank">local GenePattern Notebook</a>, against <a href="http://software.broadinstitute.org/use-genepattern" target="_blank">a server other than</a> the two listed above.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The GenePattern team is working diligently to resolve these issues as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>We apologize for an inconvenience this may be causing.</p>
