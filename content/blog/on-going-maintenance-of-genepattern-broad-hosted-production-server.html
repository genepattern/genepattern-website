<p>During a recent maintenance update, we migrated the majority of the compute nodes for the Broad-hosted production GenePattern server (<a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://genepattern.broadinstitute.org&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1475194071983000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH2pVPUW-dtRtA-eXwLTSqbjvzLhA" href="https://genepattern.broadinstitute.org" target="_blank">https://genepattern.<wbr/>broadinstitute.org</a>) to a new operating system distribution - from CentOS 5 to Red Hat (RHEL) 6.</p>
<p>In doing so, we shifted our resources from a majority of CentOS 5 nodes, to a majority of RHEL 6 nodes. Currently the modules on this server are configured to run on RHEL 6 by default. For the most part this is working and should not appear to be any different to you, our users. However we are still working through vetting all of our modules in this new environment and are aware that some are not working at this moment, and that there is a backup for those jobs which, for now, require the CentOS 5 environment.</p>
<p>We are very sensitive to the fact that this is may be frustrating either due to wait time or repeated failure and we assure you that we are working diligenty to address each issue.</p>
<p>Please feel free to <a href="/contact" target="_blank">reach out to us</a> if you have specific questions or concerns.</p>
<p>We do apologize for this disruption, and greatly appreciate your patience as we work on this matter.</p>
<p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>-The GenePattern Team</p>
