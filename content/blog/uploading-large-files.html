        Many modern GenePattern analyses are consuming multi-gigabyte input files. For example, AmpliconSuite runs 
        might use fastq files that are 70GB or larger.  Here are some tips for uploading and analyzing large files in GenePattern.

        There are 3 paths to uploading large files in GenePattern:
        <ol>
            <li> <a href="#browser">Upload in the Browser</a></li>
            <li> <a href="#globus">Transfer using Globus</a></li>
            <li>  <a href="#s3">Use S3 URIs</a></li>
        </ol>

        If you are going to work with more than the standard 30GB quota for data files, contact the GenePattern team to request a temporary larger disk quota. 
        Send us a message on the GenePattern help forum at <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/genepattern-help" target="_blank">https://groups.google.com/g/genepattern-help</a> 
        to start this process.

        <h3 id="browser">Uploads in the Browser</h3>
        You can upload files of arbitrary size to the Files tab.  One AmpliconSuite user uploaded two 60GB fastq
        files this way. Uploads to the Files tab skip the GenePattern server and go directly to our
        Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 bucket using the extremely high bandwidth and great connectivity that AWS servers enjoy.

<p dir="ltr" class="common-p">
    <span class="common-span">
         The challenge in uploading large files this way is to prevent the browser from doing a page refresh
        or the computer from going to sleep after it is started.  If you have a job running on GenePattern, it will refresh the
        page periodically, so don't start a big upload when you have any jobs are currently running.  Since the upload could take an hour
        or more, you also don't want your computer to go to sleep.  If you are using a Mac, you can use a utility like Caffeine 
        to prevent your computer from going to sleep, similar options exist for other operating systems.

    <span class="common-span">
        The File upload button on the run job page is limited to files under 2GB in size.  
        This is not the place for your really big uploads, use the Files tab instead.
    </span>

<p dir="ltr" class="common-p">
    <span class="common-span">
       <h3 id="globus">Transfer Using Globus</h3>
        Another option is to use Globus to transfer files to the GenePattern server. Detailed directions for using Globus are available
        in the <a href="https://www.genepattern.org/user-guide/#toc-3" target="_blank">GenePattern User Guide</a>.  
        It's important to initiate the Globus transfer
        from within GenePattern.  The GenePattern Globus server does not allow public read or write in order to prevent user data from being
        visible to other users.  Initiating the transfer from withing GenePattern, allows us to set up ACLs on a directory to ensure
        privacy.  A common issue with large Globus transfers is that the transfer will fail if your files are coming from a 
        Globus Connect Personal endpoint, and the endpoint host goes to sleep or disconnects.  This is seen when the endpoint
        is running on a laptop or desktop computer and the laptop is closed or the desktop goes to sleep from lack of user
        interaction.  Here again apps like Caffeine can help prevent the computer from going to sleep.

    <span class="common-span">
        <h3 id="s3">Use S3 URIs</h3>
        The third option is to use S3 URIs to refer to files that are already in a S3 bucket.  If the files are in a public S3 bucket,
        you can use the S3 URI directly in a file type parameter.  Simply enter the S3 URI in the "add Path or URL" input
        for a file. If the files are in a private S3 bucket, you will need to set up a presigned URL for the file.  You can
        refer to the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html">AWS documentation 
        for how to create a presigned URL</a>.  Once you have the presigned URL, you can use it in the "add Path or URL" input
        for the file parameter.
