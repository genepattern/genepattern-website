<p><strong>Java  7 update 55 and Windows: </strong>We have been receiving reports from our users and have ourselves noticed that the latest Java 7 update (Java 7 update 55) has caused visualizers to fail to launch on Windows (On Mac they seem to launch with Firefox most reliably, but also with Safari).</p>
<p>We are working on a short term fix for this and will update this blog again when we have more information. We greatly appreciate your patience as we work through the issues that have arisen from these recent Java updates, and apologize for an inconvenience or disruption this has caused. Please feel free to <a href="/contact" target="_blank">contact us</a> with any questions or comments. We are always happy to hear from you.</p>
