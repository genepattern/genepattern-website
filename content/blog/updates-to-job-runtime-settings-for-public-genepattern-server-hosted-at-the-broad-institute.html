<p>To help alleviate some of the heavy traffic we have seen in recent months on the <a href="https://genepattern.broadinstitute.org">public GenePattern server hosted at the Broad Institute</a>, <strong>we have implemented a job</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>walltime</strong><strong> limit of 36 hours</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This means that, by default, jobs will be limited to running for 36 hours. After that, jobs will be terminated by the server.Â </li>
</ul>
