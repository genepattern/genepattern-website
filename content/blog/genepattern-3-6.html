<h3>
	Updated Job Submit Page</h3>
<p>
	In GenePattern 3.6, the job submit page (the page that appears when you select a module or pipeline) has been revised for ease of use.  The user interface has been streamlined with clearer drag--and-drop targets, updated buttons and other UI elements, and reorganized module information in the header.</p>

<h4>
	Improved File Input</h4>
<p>
	We have improved file input to modules and pipelines in a number of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
		You can drag-and-drop your input files from your desktop or from the Job Results, Uploads, and GenomeSpace tabs</li>
<li>
		There is a new upload progress bar that appears after you click the <em>Run</em> button if you are directly uploading files from your client file system (via drag-and-drop from the local file system or the <em>Upload File</em> button)</li>
</ul>
<h4>
	Drag-and-drop File Lists</h4>
<p>
	We have implemented the ability to drag-and-drop/upload multiple files for a single module run; this provides an alternative to having to make a text file containing the absolute paths or URLs to each file, making it much easier to do a single module run on a set of files.  These files can come from a direct upload, a previous job result, the GenomeSpace tab, or an external URL.  This works for any module or pipeline that has file lists enabled.</p>
<h2>
<a name="fixes"></a>Fixes/Enhancements</h2>
<p>
	The 3.6 release fixes issues in GenePattern, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
		Fixing a bug that prevented files from the Job Results and GenomeSpace tabs from being sent to the GENE-E module</li>
<li>
		Improved error handling for files and job submission failures</li>
</ul>
