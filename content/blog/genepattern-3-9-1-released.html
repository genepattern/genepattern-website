<div><strong><a name="Mavericks install">Installing GenePattern on Mac OSX 10.9 (Mavericks) or 10.10 (Yosemite)</a></strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>With Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) Apple instituted a variety of application requirements that are incompatible with the GenePattern installer, which also apply to OS X 10.10 (Yosemite). As a consequence, those attempting to install GenePattern on Mavericks or Yosemite may encounter the following error message:</div>
</div>
<p><img alt="" src="/uploaded/content_content_damaged.jpg" style="width: 420px; height: 153px;"/></p>
<div>Despite this error message the GenePattern installer is not actually damaged. The message is part of a new Apple security measure. There are two options for working around this error and proceeding with a GenePattern installation, depending on your administrative privileges.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To determine if you have the appropriate admin privileges follow the instructions for <a href="#admin privs">If you have administrator privileges</a> below. If the <em>Allow apps downloaded from…</em> text remains grayed out throughout the steps, it is unlikely that you have the necessary privileges. In this case, please follow the steps beneath <a href="#no admin privs">If you do not have administrator privileges.</a></div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong><a name="admin privs">If you have administrator privileges</a></strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you are an admin on your Mac computer you can temporarily disable the security settings that prevent GenePattern from being installed. To do this perform the following steps.</div>
<ol>
<li>Open System Preferences found in <em>Applications &gt; System Preferences</em></li>
<li>Click on the <em>Security &amp; Privacy</em> icon</li>
<li>Click on the <em>General</em> tab</li>
<li>In the bottom half of the window set <em>Allow apps downloaded from</em>… to <em>Anywhere</em>. If this section is grayed out you may first have to click the lock icon in the lower left corner of the window and enter your password.</li>
<li>Start the GenePattern installer by double-clicking the downloaded file. Once GenePattern is installed the previous security settings may be reapplied.</li>
</ol>
<div><a name="no admin privs"><strong>If you do not have administrator privileges</strong></a></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Another possibility for installing GenePattern is to start the installer from the command line. To do this perform the following steps.</div>
<ol>
<li>Use the Terminal application found in <em>Applications &gt; Utilities</em> to navigate to the <em>Downloads </em>directory and type <code>"cd ~/Downloads</code>"</li>
<li>Find the <em>GPserver.app</em> directory and navigate to <em>Contents&gt;MacOS</em> and type <code>"cd GPserver.app/Contents/MacOS</code>"</li>
<li>Run the installer with<code> "./GPserver"</code></li>
</ol>
