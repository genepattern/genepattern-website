    <p>We are asking for your help with ensuring the continued funding and enhancement of the GenePattern ecosystem.</p>
    <p>We propose to expand the tools available to include new approaches such as immuno-oncology, spatial transcriptomics, metabolomics, and multi-omic assays. Importantly, we will also incorporate LLMs to create an agent for GenePattern that will serve as an all-purpose bioinformatics assistant, helping scientists design and execute analyses and workflows.</p>
<p>A brief email of support from you will make a strong impression on the study section that reviews our proposal and can underscore its significance and impact when the grant is reviewed. We ask that you describe how your use of the GenePattern ecosystem in the past has supported your work, and why you feel our vision for the new GenePattern aims will be an important enhancement of the platform for bioinformatics research.</p>
	<p>For your email of support to be included in our submission, please send your emails to <a href="mailto:genepattern-los@cloud.ucsd.edu" target="_blank">genepattern-los@cloud.ucsd.edu</a> <b>on or before Friday July 11, 2025</b>.</p> <p>Thanks in advance for your help and support.</p><p>The GenePattern Team</p>
