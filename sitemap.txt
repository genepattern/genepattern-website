https://www.genepattern.org/modules/docs/ReplicatesQC/11/
Module for quality control assessment of replicate samples. Calculates correlation, concordance, and other metrics between technical or biological replicates to assess reproducibility and identify problematic samples or outliers.

https://www.genepattern.org/modules/docs/RenameFile/1/
Simple utility module for renaming files within a GenePattern workflow. Useful for organizing outputs and ensuring files have meaningful names for subsequent analysis steps or archiving.

https://www.genepattern.org/modules/docs/RenameSamplesGCT/1/
Module for renaming sample identifiers in GCT gene expression files. Often needed when consolidating data from multiple sources or preparing files for tools that require specific sample naming conventions.

https://www.genepattern.org/modules/docs/AffySTExpressionFileCreator/2/
Module for processing Affymetrix ST (Gene or Exon) array data to create expression files. Handles normalization and summarization of probe-level data to produce gene-level or exon-level expression values from Affymetrix expression arrays.

https://www.genepattern.org/modules/docs/AgilentExpressionFileCreator/0.8/
Module for processing Agilent microarray data to create standardized expression files. Converts raw Agilent array data through quality control, normalization, and summarization steps to produce expression matrices for analysis.

https://www.genepattern.org/modules/docs/AgilentToGCT/1/
Converter module for transforming Agilent microarray data to GCT format. GCT is GenePattern's standard format for expression data, enabling use of Agilent array data with the full suite of GenePattern expression analysis modules.

https://www.genepattern.org/modules/docs/txt2odf/3/
Utility module for converting plain text files to ODF (Open Document Format) used by some GenePattern modules. Enables integration of external data into GenePattern workflows by converting to expected input formats.

https://www.genepattern.org/modules/docs/PARIS/60/
PARIS module, likely related to pathway or network analysis given common bioinformatics naming patterns. May involve identifying perturbed pathways, analyzing regulatory networks, or performing functional enrichment analysis in the context of genomic data.

https://www.genepattern.org/modules/docs/NormLines/54/
Module for normalization operations on line-based genomic data. May involve normalizing signal across genomic regions, adjusting for technical variation, or standardizing measurements across samples or experiments.

https://www.genepattern.org/modules/docs/FilterLowshRNAs/29/
Module for filtering out poorly performing or low-abundance shRNAs from RNAi screening data. Removing low-signal shRNAs before analysis improves statistical power and reduces noise in identifying phenotypic hits from genome-scale screens.

https://www.genepattern.org/modules/docs/shRNAcollapseReps/9/
https://www.genepattern.org/modules/docs/shRNAfoldChange/5/
https://www.genepattern.org/modules/docs/shRNAmapGenes/7/
https://www.genepattern.org/modules/docs/shRNAremoveOverlap/8/
Suite of modules for processing RNAi screening data. These modules handle collapsing technical replicates, calculating fold changes in shRNA abundance, mapping shRNAs to target genes, and removing overlapping or ambiguous shRNAs. Together they create a complete workflow for analyzing pooled shRNA screens.

https://www.genepattern.org/modules/docs/FP_matching/38/
Module for fingerprint matching, likely comparing molecular fingerprints (chemical structures), genetic fingerprints, or other characteristic profiles to identify similar entities or validate sample identity across experiments.

https://www.genepattern.org/modules/docs/Read_group_trackingToGct/1/
Module for converting Cufflinks read group tracking files to GCT format. Enables analysis of RNA-seq transcript abundance data using GenePattern's expression analysis modules by converting from Tuxedo suite output format.

https://www.genepattern.org/modules/docs/removeSamples/17/
Utility module for removing specified samples from a dataset. Used to exclude outliers, failed samples, or unwanted controls from analysis datasets without manually editing data files.

https://www.genepattern.org/modules/docs/Hisat2Indexer/1/
Module for building HISAT2 genome indexes required for RNA-seq alignment. Genome indexing is a one-time preprocessing step that creates data structures enabling fast read alignment by HISAT2.

https://www.genepattern.org/modules/docs/ABasicModule/1/
Example or template module demonstrating basic GenePattern module structure. Likely used for training module developers or as a starting point for creating new modules with standard parameter handling and file I/O.
